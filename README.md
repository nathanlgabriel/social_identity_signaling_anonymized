Here is some sample code [here](https://github.com/nathanlgabriel/social_identity_signaling_anonymized/tree/main/code). The .ipynb files are the notebooks used to run simulations. Many sections of the paper have simulation results from more than one notebook. But, I've included at least one notebook for the models in each section: [Section 2.3](https://github.com/nathanlgabriel/social_identity_signaling_anonymized/blob/main/code/genBS_v0055k_assort_FLIP7_repNOexec_sm_sweep_Merced_top212-Copy3.ipynb) [Section 3.2](https://github.com/nathanlgabriel/social_identity_signaling_anonymized/blob/main/code/genBS_v0055k_assort_FLIP7_repNOexec_sm_sweep_Merced_top212signals.ipynb) [Section 3.4](https://github.com/nathanlgabriel/social_identity_signaling_anonymized/blob/main/code/genBS_v0055k_assort_FLIP7_repEXEC_sm_sweep_SF_top213signals-Copy1.ipynb) [Section 4.1](https://github.com/nathanlgabriel/social_identity_signaling_anonymized/blob/main/code/genBS_v0055k_assort_FLIP7_repEXEC_sm_sweep_Merced_top_intersec.ipynb) [Section 4.2](https://github.com/nathanlgabriel/social_identity_signaling_anonymized/blob/main/code/genBS_v0055k_assort_FLIP7_repEXEC_sm_sweep_Merced_topA-Copy4.ipynb) [Section 4.3](https://github.com/nathanlgabriel/social_identity_signaling_anonymized/blob/main/code/genBS_v0055k_assort_FLIP7_repexec_SMARTmutate_top_23D-Copy7.ipynb) [Section 4.4](https://github.com/nathanlgabriel/social_identity_signaling_anonymized/blob/main/code/genBS_v0055k_assort_FLIP7_repEXEC_sm_sweep_Merced_topC-Copy4.ipynb). All of these notebooks call functions from [this file](https://github.com/nathanlgabriel/social_identity_signaling_anonymized/blob/main/code/FNs_genBachStravinsky_v0055k_assort_FLIP7_rep_execNULLsig_SMARTmutation.py), which must be located in the same directory as the notebooks for them to work properly. The code was only commented for my own use, and I am happy to provide further explainations of the code via email correspondence. I always record the random entropy used to seed the random number generators so results can be replicated exactly if the need arises.

Code for Appendix B's model with reinforcement learning dynamics is [here](https://github.com/nathanlgabriel/social_identity_signaling_anonymized/tree/main/code/reinforcement)


The jupyter notebooks in code/partial_information_decomposition contain code for calculating the synergistic information for the model expoloring intersectionality, Section 4.1, with β = 0. Specifically, this is the synergistic information between signals in the first dimension, X1, the second dimension, X2,  and the greeting that Kishus give in response to those singals, Y. The calculation of synergistic information is done using the formulation given by Varley and Kaminski (2022)'s ["Untangling Synergistic Effects of Intersecting Social Identities with Partial Information Decomposition"](https://doi.org/10.3390/e24101387), using Williams and Beer's I_min definition of redundant information. One notebook contains the calculation for the equilibrium in which Kishus give the Kish greeting among themselves (approximately 0.659, corresponding to around 49% of total information). The other contains calculations for the equilibrium in which Kishus give the Umma greeting among themselves (apporximately 0.382, corresponding to around 36% of total information). Therefore, we see that our understanding of intersectionality coheres with Varley and Kaminski's since the synergistic information in the equilibrium we associate with intersectional identities is nearly double the synergistic information in the equilibrium which we associate with Kishus merely being members of both groups.
